This repository ("horiseon") is used to refractor the [Horiseon](https://gusmor94.github.io/horiSEOn/) web application product. In this repository you'll find that images have been given proper "alt" attributes, in order to follow accessibility standards. The html code has been adjusted to use semantic html elements, with a logical structure. As well as, the css file has been consolidated to follow a more logical, and less repetitive, use of selectors.
